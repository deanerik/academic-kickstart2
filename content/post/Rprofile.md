Post in progress:

If you're having trouble with your rprofile, it might be because you don't have a trailing newline.

The last line of the profile is ignored, so you'll want to have some dummy line in there so that the previous ones are recognized.

I wanted to set my r profile to use my anaconda distribution of python, so I had put both lines in.
