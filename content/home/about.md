# Synopsis

" Erik K Dean is a PhD student at the University of Toronto, working to address the alien invasions of the future. As climate change progresses, aquatic habitats, and the communities of fishes within them are projected to be deeply reshaped. Arising from this flux is the potential arrival, and survival of invasive alien species, such as the Asian Carps, which could have  greatly harm the economically, and ecologically valuable Great Lakes. Erik is developing models using traditional, and machine learning techniques, to predict the future environmental conditions which would enable such invasions, and when they may happen. "
