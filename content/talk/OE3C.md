# Abstract and optional shortened version. 
abstract = "Bighead Carp are a highly invasive, fast-growing and voracious species of fish that are abundant in
the Mississippi River. There is a growing concern of their potential to expand northwards and enter
the Canadian Great Lakes; however, they may encounter different environmental conditions that affect
their growth and maturation. At higher latitudes, Bighead Carp have been observed to mature later
in life and grow at a reduced rate. Under a changing climate, warmer temperatures are expected in
the Great Lakes, potentially enabling the earlier maturation and faster growth seen at lower latitudes.
This study presents a stage-based matrix population model that incorporates variable age of maturity,
growth, survival, and fecundity parameters that shift with temperature to explore potential Bighead
Carp invasions. Model simulations show that earlier maturation results in greater population growth;
however, anticipated climate change may not be sufficient to induce early maturation in the near
future. Alternatively, model outputs show that the fecundity of the initial individuals to arrive in the
Great Lakes is the most influential to the rate of invasion."
